# -Transforming-Customer-Insights-Sentiment-Analysis-in-Action-
In today's digital age, understanding customer sentiment is crucial for businesses and content creators. Leveraging social media and online reviews provides a goldmine of data that can drive informed decisions, enhance customer satisfaction, and protect brand reputation.

Overview
This repository provides a tool for sentiment analysis, specifically designed to process user reviews from JSON data. The tool categorizes reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on the frequency of positive and negative keywords. This can be extended to analyze social media comments or other text data to identify sentiment trends.

Features

Data Parsing: Reads JSON data containing user reviews.

Text Preprocessing: Removes stopwords and punctuation for cleaner analysis.

Sentiment Analysis: Determines the sentiment of each review and classifies it as positive, neutral, or negative.

Keyword Extraction: Identifies frequent keywords in positive and negative reviews.

Output Generation: Writes sentiment analysis results to an output file.
