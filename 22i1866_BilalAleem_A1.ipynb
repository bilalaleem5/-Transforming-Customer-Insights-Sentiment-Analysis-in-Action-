pairing buds difficult all, would get annoying real quick.now i've got way, talk stuff like buds, pretty much everything. first off, let assure headset support apt-x bluetooth connections available. apt-x bluetooth audio codec designed provide sound quality equal wired headset. bluetooth audio connections compress audio, making sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. happens regardless quality source audio file. apt-x support commonly available recent samsung (including galaxy s3, s4, s5) htc phones (including one m8), others well. you&#8217;re interested, ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available jessebandersen dot com, simple google search also yield results. found jesse&#8217;s page searching &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; first result list. sadly apt-x supported apple yet, knowing they'll come proprietary alternative works headsets (they bought beats dre last week so, get ready). almost passed buds apt-x isn't listed anywhere specs reviews saw amazon. go motorola's site look user manual find it. originally going go lg tone headset line (which also supports apt-x), didn't like &#34;flat loop&#34; design &#8211; looks like great fit&#8230; robot. opinion buds designed better fit actual human: front control stalks bend gently down, following curve neck/shoulders/collarbones. majority headset (including small weight battery pack) rests base neck, control stalks rest comfortably near collarbones. lg tone can't time since formed flat circle: stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative neck band, carry weight battery they&#8217;ll fall collarbones center section halfway back neck (the newer ones curved like buds, $70 expensive). i&#8217;m wearing buds headset right now, hardly feel &#8211; great improvement traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; bluetooth headsets. i&#8217;m talking fit, probably mention wear 17.5&#8221; collar, can&#8217;t stand things touching neck throat. buds fit quite comfortably, provide slightest reassuring touch front sides neck. widest gap left right control stalks measures hair 5 inches.the buds tidy control arrangement easy navigate. play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well eq settings voice dial activation) handled rocker switch left, volume adjustments handled rocker switch right. microphone underneath rocker switch left, power switch underneath body (center section) headset, next charging port. play/pause/answer/end done single press forward half left rocker switch, little bit texture identification/grip purposes. activate voice dialing (like siri samsung&#8217;s s-voice google voice search) long-pressing button music playing. track-skip forward done single press back half switch, track-skip back done double press. kind wish skip forward/back handled separate buttons, it&#8217;s easy enough get used to. one thing note mic stalk answer/end button: feel around end call button, person end going hear since microphone right beneath it. lots loud rustling noises. oops. enough list full-on downside, still... kind annoying. could placed mic right, come think whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221;
